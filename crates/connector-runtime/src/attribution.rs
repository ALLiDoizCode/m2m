//! What a terminating connector tells the app about the payment that
//! brought a packet to it (ADR 0040, issue #994): three request headers on
//! the delivery, and only when this connector itself verified the payment
//! they describe.
//!
//! The TypeScript prototype sent the same three header names from sources
//! that could not carry their meaning -- `X-TOON-Payer` was the immediate
//! previous hop, `X-TOON-Chain` was the second label of the destination
//! address, i.e. chosen by whoever addressed the packet. ADR 0017 found
//! both wrong by construction and [ADR
//! 0036](../../../docs/adr/0036-a-paid-deliverys-attribution-stays-on-the-connector.md)
//! concluded from that they had no successor at all. ADR 0040 supersedes
//! that conclusion, not its reasoning: the names come back, bound to a
//! source that cannot name the wrong party.
//!
//! **The source is the admitted claim, and nothing else.** The only value
//! this module will ever put on the wire is the chain-namespaced client
//! channel key a covering claim was accepted under at this connector's own
//! client edge -- the key whose signature was checked against the
//! counterparty this node records for that channel (client-edge-spec.md
//! §1.3), the same key ADR 0036 put on the `"packet"` span and the
//! client-edge claim journal writes its `InboundClaimAccepted` entries
//! under. There is no other input:
//!
//! - **A longer path emits nothing.** A peer-role arrival, a forwarded
//!   packet, an unclaimed request -- none of them admitted a client claim
//!   here, so none of them carry a payer, and the header is absent rather
//!   than guessed. ADR 0017's "on any path longer than one hop the header
//!   names the wrong party" is therefore not merely avoided by convention;
//!   there is no code path that can produce it.
//! - **A free route emits nothing.** Attribution describes a payment; a
//!   route priced at zero took none.
//! - **The caller's own headers never survive.** Whatever the sender put
//!   inside the sealed envelope under one of these three names is removed
//!   before anything is injected -- on *every* delivery, including the ones
//!   that then inject nothing. An app reading `X-TOON-Payer` is reading
//!   this connector or reading nothing.
