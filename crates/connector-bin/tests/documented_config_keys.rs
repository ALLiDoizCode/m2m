//! Guards the committed config-key table against the parser (issue #900).
//!
//! `README.md`'s "Configure" section documented `peer_wire_addr`, a key the
//! parser refuses by name -- an operator who copied it got a node that
//! refused to start (connector#849). `refuses_to_start.rs` proves the
//! parser's side of that; nothing proved the table's. This file reads the
//! committed table and, for every key it names, hands the same parser a
//! probe config setting that key and asserts it is not rejected as an
//! unrecognized or removed key.
//!
//! **The table moved** (issue #1173). It used to be the README's; the README
//! is now an operator's guide and the key table lives in
//! `docs/protocol/configuration-spec.md` §2.1, which is the document that
//! already owned the configuration contract and carries the CF- rules each
//! key expresses. Nothing about the check changed -- it reads whatever rows
//! the committed table has -- but the file it reads did, and a gate that
//! silently reads the wrong file is worse than no gate, so the section
//! lookup below panics rather than defaulting when it cannot find the table.
//!
//! Deliberately does not read a second, hand-maintained list of "the keys
//! the spec should have" -- that list would drift from the table under test
//! exactly the way the table drifted from the parser. The table's own rows
//! are the input.
