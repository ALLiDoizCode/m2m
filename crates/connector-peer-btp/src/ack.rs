//! The claim acknowledgement on the wire (`peer-carriage-spec.md` §6).
//!
//! A `claim-ack` is a **field on the response the carriage already
//! requires** for the claim-bearing frame -- never a frame of its own
//! (§6.1). On BTP it is a `claim-ack` protocolData entry on the RESPONSE
//! under the claim-bearing MESSAGE's or TRANSFER's `requestId`, carrying
//! raw UTF-8 JSON:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "result": "accepted" }
//! { "result": "rejected", "reason": "signature_invalid" }
//! ```
//!
//! **One refusal taxonomy** (spec I3): [`ClaimRejectReason`] → this JSON is
//! the single function [`encode`], called by whichever carriage is
//! answering. A fifth variant added to that enum without a corresponding
//! arm here does not compile, so it cannot appear on one carriage and not
//! the other.
//!
//! **Absence and malformation both mean NOT ACKNOWLEDGED** (§6.3). That is
//! the honest loss of moving CLAIM_ACK from a frame type to a field: as an
//! entry it is omissible, where a distinct frame type made "the peer sent
//! no ack" inexpressible. [`decode`] therefore returns `None` for every
//! shape that is not exactly one of the two above -- undecodable JSON, an
//! unknown `result`, an unknown `reason`, a `rejected` with no `reason` --
//! and a caller must never read `None` as either verdict.
