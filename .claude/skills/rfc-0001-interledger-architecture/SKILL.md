# RFC 0001: Interledger Architecture

## Overview

Provides expert guidance on Interledger Protocol architecture including the layer model, payment routing, connector design, and ledger abstraction as specified in RFC 0001.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Architecture Explanation
Answer questions about Interledger's layered architecture and design principles using the MCP tool:
```
mcp__interledger_org-v4_Docs__search_rfcs_documentation
```

Search with queries like:
- "interledger architecture layers"
- "protocol stack design"
- "ledger abstraction model"

### 2. Protocol Layer Guidance
Explain the different protocol layers (Application, Transport, Interledger, Ledger) and their responsibilities.

### 3. Payment Routing
Describe how payments are routed through connectors across different ledgers.

### 4. Integration Advice
Help users understand how to integrate with the Interledger architecture.

## Common Topics
- Layer model and separation of concerns
- Connector architecture and responsibilities
- Routing and forwarding mechanisms
- Ledger abstraction principles
- End-to-end payment flows
