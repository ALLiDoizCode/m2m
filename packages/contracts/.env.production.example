# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Use hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) for mainnet deployment keys
# 2. NEVER use Anvil development private keys in production
# 3. Rotate keys after suspected compromise
# 4. Use dedicated RPC endpoints (Alchemy, Infura) for production reliability
# 5. Verify contract on Etherscan immediately after deployment
