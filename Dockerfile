# Multi-stage Dockerfile for ILP Connector
#
# Stage 1 (builder): Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript with all dependencies
# Stage 1.5 (ui-builder): Builds Explorer UI with Vite
# Stage 2 (runtime): Runs compiled connector with production dependencies only
#
# Build: docker build -t ilp-connector .
# Run:   docker run -e NODE_ID=connector-a -e BTP_SERVER_PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 ilp-connector

# Install all dependencies (including devDependencies for TypeScript compilation)
# Use npm ci for reproducible builds
# Use --ignore-scripts to skip prepare script (git hooks not needed in Docker builds)

# Build shared first, then connector (dependency order)
# Use build:connector-only to skip UI build (UI is built in ui-builder stage)

# Install wget for health check (minimal package, available in Alpine)
# Used by Docker HEALTHCHECK to query HTTP health endpoint

# Security hardening: Run as non-root user
# Alpine's node image includes a 'node' user by default
# Change ownership of application files to node user
RUN chown -R node:node /app

# Expose BTP server port (WebSocket)
# Default: 3000 (configurable via BTP_SERVER_PORT environment variable)

# Expose Explorer UI port (HTTP/WebSocket)

# Interval: Check every 30 seconds (balance between responsiveness and overhead)
# Timeout: Health endpoint must respond within 10 seconds
# Start period: Allow 40 seconds for connector startup (BTP connections establishment)
# Retries: Mark unhealthy after 3 consecutive failures

# The health endpoint returns:
# - 200 OK when connector is healthy (≥50% peers connected)
# - 503 Service Unavailable when unhealthy or starting
