# Docker Compose configuration for hub-and-spoke ILP network
# Topology: Central hub with 3 spoke connectors
#
#           Hub (Port 3000)
#          /  |  \
#         /   |   \
#        /    |    \
#     Spoke1 Spoke2 Spoke3
#    (3001) (3002) (3003)
#
# Connections: Hub ← Spokes (spokes initiate connections to hub)
# All traffic must route through the hub
#
# Explorer UI Access:
#   - Hub:    http://localhost:3010
#   - Spoke1: http://localhost:3011
#   - Spoke2: http://localhost:3012
#   - Spoke3: http://localhost:3013
#
# Usage:
#   Start: docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.hub-spoke.yml up -d
#   Logs:  docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.hub-spoke.yml logs -f
#   Stop:  docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.hub-spoke.yml down
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Build the connector image: docker build -t ilp-connector .
#
# Configuration:
#   Each connector loads its configuration from a YAML file mounted as a volume.
#   Configuration files: examples/hub-spoke-{hub,spoke1,spoke2,spoke3}.yaml
#   This topology provides a centralized routing architecture where the hub
#   controls all inter-spoke communication.
