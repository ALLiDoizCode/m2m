# Project Brief: ILP Connector with BTP and Network Visualization

## Executive Summary

This project aims to build an **Interledger Protocol (ILP) connector** that implements the **Bilateral Transfer Protocol (BTP)** for ledger-layer communication, enabling the deployment of multiple interconnected nodes via Docker containers. The system will provide real-time visualization and comprehensive logging of ILP packet routing across the network, allowing developers and researchers to observe payment flow through the Interledger architecture.

**Primary Problem:** Understanding and debugging Interledger payment routing is challenging without visual representation of packet flow across connector networks.

**Target Market:** Blockchain developers, payment systems engineers, fintech researchers, and Interledger protocol developers who need to understand, test, and demonstrate ILP connector behavior.

**Key Value Proposition:** A containerized, observable ILP network that makes the invisible routing of cross-ledger payments visible through intuitive visualization and detailed logging.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

The Interledger Protocol enables payments across different ledgers and payment networks, but the complexity of multi-hop routing through connectors creates several challenges:

- **Lack of Visibility:** Packets traveling through ILP connectors are opaque to observers, making it difficult to understand routing decisions, packet transformations, and protocol behavior
- **Complex Setup:** Deploying multiple interconnected ILP nodes requires significant configuration overhead and expertise
- **Debugging Difficulty:** When payments fail or behave unexpectedly, developers lack tools to trace packet flow through the network
- **Educational Barriers:** Learning Interledger concepts is abstract without seeing actual packet routing in action

### Impact of the Problem

- Developers waste significant time debugging ILP integration issues
- Protocol researchers cannot easily experiment with different network topologies
- Educational adoption of Interledger is hindered by high conceptual barriers
- Testing connector implementations lacks standardized observable environments

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Existing ILP implementations (like Interledger.js) focus on production functionality but lack:
- Built-in visualization capabilities
- Easy multi-node deployment orchestration
- Comprehensive packet-level logging and tracing
- Developer-friendly observability tools

### Urgency and Importance

As Interledger adoption grows for cross-border payments and web monetization, the need for developer tools that demystify the protocol becomes critical. This project addresses a fundamental gap in the Interledger ecosystem.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

Build a **containerized ILP connector implementation** that:

1. **Implements RFC-0027 (ILPv4)** - Core protocol for packet routing
2. **Implements RFC-0023 (BTP)** - Bilateral Transfer Protocol for ledger communication
3. **Deploys via Docker Compose** - N-node networks with simple configuration
4. **Provides Real-time Visualization** - Web-based dashboard showing packet flow
5. **Offers Comprehensive Logging** - Structured logs of all ILP operations

### Key Differentiators

- **Observability-First Design:** Unlike production connectors, this tool prioritizes visibility into internal operations
- **Zero-Config Network Deployment:** Docker Compose orchestration eliminates complex setup
- **Educational Focus:** Clear visualizations make Interledger concepts tangible
- **Developer Experience:** Rich logging and debugging capabilities built-in from day one

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

- Leverages proven technologies (Docker, ILPv4, BTP) with well-documented specifications
- Addresses a clear, unmet need in the Interledger developer community
- Can serve dual purposes: education and testing/debugging
- Builds on official RFCs ensuring protocol compliance

### High-Level Vision

A developer runs `docker-compose up`, specifies the number of connector nodes, and immediately sees a visual network diagram with packets flowing between nodes as test payments are sent, with expandable logs showing packet contents, routing decisions, and protocol state at each hop.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **RFC Complexity:** Implementing full ILPv4 and BTP compliance may be more complex than estimated
  - *Mitigation:* Start with minimal RFC-compliant subset, iterate to full compliance

- **Visualization Performance:** Real-time visualization may degrade with high packet rates
  - *Mitigation:* Implement sampling/throttling, optimize rendering with virtualization

- **Community Adoption:** Project may not gain traction if ILP community is too small
  - *Mitigation:* Active promotion in Interledger forums, integration with existing tools

- **Maintenance Burden:** As solo developer, ongoing maintenance could become overwhelming
  - *Mitigation:* Document extensively, seek co-maintainers early, keep architecture simple

- **Technology Choice Risk:** Choosing wrong tech stack could limit functionality or performance
  - *Mitigation:* Prototype key components (visualization, BTP) before full commitment

### Open Questions

- Should we support ILP-over-HTTP in addition to BTP, or focus exclusively on BTP?
- What level of BTP authentication is sufficient for educational use cases?
- Should visualization be real-time only, or also support historical playback?
- How do we handle network topologies with 50+ nodes (future scalability)?
- Should we integrate with existing ILP test networks or remain isolated?
- What metrics are most valuable to developers debugging routing issues?
- Should we provide pre-built Docker images or expect users to build locally?
- How do we balance visual simplicity with showing protocol details?

Key findings:
- BTP uses WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
- ILP packets are stateless and can be routed independently
- Connectors must maintain routing tables and peer relationships
- Error handling is critical for payment completion guarantees

#### Competitive Analysis

Existing Interledger tools:
- **Interledger.js:** Reference implementation, production-focused, lacks visualization
- **ILP Kit:** Deprecated connector/wallet combo, no longer maintained
- **Moneyd:** Local ILP node, minimal observability features

**Gap identified:** No modern, actively maintained tool focused on visualization and education.
