# Story 18.4: Capability Query & Filter

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** agent developer implementing capability discovery,
**I want** to query and filter peer capability events from local storage and relays,
**so that** agents can discover peers with specific capabilities, pricing, and availability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Query Kind 31990 events from local storage
2. Query Kind 31990 events from relays
3. Filter by supported kind (k tag)
4. Filter by agent type
5. Filter by price range
6. Filter by ILP address prefix
7. Sort by pricing, capacity, freshness
8. Return parsed `AgentCapability` objects

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 18.1 defined the AgentCapability type and AgentCapabilitySchema Zod validator. Story 18.2 implemented CapabilityPublisher which creates Kind 31990 events. Story 18.3 added pricing tags. This story implements the query side - finding and parsing those capability events.

Key insights:

- Kind 31990 event structure is defined in Story 18.2
- Tag parsing logic will mirror tag building logic from CapabilityPublisher
- AgentEventDatabase.queryEvents() accepts NostrFilter (kind, #k, authors, etc.)
- AgentCapability type and schema already exist in types.ts from Story 18.1

[Source: Story 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 completion notes]

### Data Models

**CapabilityQuery Interface:**

```typescript
interface CapabilityQuery {
  /** Filter by required event kinds (AND logic - capability must support all) */
  requiredKinds?: number[];
  /** Filter by agent types (OR logic - capability matches any) */
  agentTypes?: AgentType[];
  /** Maximum price per kind in millisatoshis */
  maxPrice?: bigint;
  /** Filter by ILP address prefix (e.g., "g.agent.alice") */
  ilpAddressPrefix?: string;
  /** Only query followed agents (requires FollowGraphRouter) */
  followedOnly?: boolean;
  /** Limit number of results */
  limit?: number;
}
```

**NostrFilter for Querying:**

```typescript
const filter: NostrFilter = {
  kinds: [31990],
  '#k': query.requiredKinds?.map((k) => k.toString()), // Filter by k tags
  // authors: [...followedPubkeys] if followedOnly
};
```

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.4 Technical Notes, Nostr NIP-01 Filter spec]

**AgentCapability Type (from Story 18.1):**

```typescript
interface AgentCapability {
  pubkey: string;
  identifier: string; // d tag (ILP address)
  supportedKinds: number[]; // k tags
  supportedNips: string[]; // nip tags
  agentType: AgentType;
  ilpAddress: string;
  pricing: Map<number, PricingEntry>;
  capacity?: CapacityInfo;
  model?: string;
  skills?: string[];
  metadata: AgentMetadata;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### File Locations

Based on Epic 18 Package Structure:

```
packages/connector/src/agent/discovery/
├── types.ts                         # UPDATE: Add CapabilityQuery interface
├── capability-query.ts              # NEW: CapabilityQueryService class
├── __tests__/
│   └── capability-query.test.ts     # NEW: Unit tests
```

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Package Structure, Story 18.2 File List]

### Technical Constraints

**NostrFilter Structure:**

- Use AgentEventDatabase.queryEvents(filter: NostrFilter)
- kind: 31990 for capability events
- #k: array of event kinds to filter by k tags
- Can filter by authors if followedOnly is true

[Source: Agent Event Database API, Nostr NIP-01]

**Tag Parsing:**

Tags are arrays of strings. Parse them carefully:

- d tag: `['d', identifier]` → capability.identifier
- k tags: `['k', kind]` → capability.supportedKinds (collect all)
- nip tags: `['nip', nip]` → capability.supportedNips (collect all)
- agent-type tag: `['agent-type', type]` → capability.agentType
- ilp-address tag: `['ilp-address', address]` → capability.ilpAddress
- pricing tags: `['pricing', kind, amount, currency]` → pricing Map
- capacity tag: `['capacity', maxConcurrent, queueDepth]` → capacity object

[Source: Story 18.2 - CapabilityPublisher tag building]

**BigInt Handling:**

- Pricing amounts in tags are strings, convert to bigint
- maxPrice query param is bigint for type safety
- Compare bigints directly for price filtering

[Source: Story 18.3 - BigInt usage in pricing]

**Sorting Priority:**

1. Pricing (lowest first) - prefer cheaper agents
2. Capacity (highest maxConcurrent first) - prefer higher capacity
3. Freshness (newest first) - prefer recent capability updates

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.4 AC 7]

**Error Handling:**

- Invalid event structure should be logged and skipped (not thrown)
- Zod validation errors should skip the event
- Relay connection errors should not fail the entire query
- Missing optional fields should not fail parsing

[Source: Coding Standards - Error Handling]

**Relay Integration:**

- Relay querying is optional (relay client may not be provided)
- If relay client exists, query relays and merge with local results
- Deduplicate by event ID (local + relay may have duplicates)
- Relay errors should be logged but not block local results

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**

- `packages/connector/src/agent/discovery/__tests__/capability-query.test.ts` (unit tests)
- Integration tests can be added to existing agent integration test files

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - File Convention]

**Test Standards:**

- Framework: Jest 29.7.x with TypeScript support (ts-jest)
- Coverage Requirement: >80% line coverage for connector package
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock dependencies: AgentEventDatabase, relay client

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - AI Agent Requirements]

**Specific Test Cases Required:**

CapabilityQueryService tests:

- Query from local storage returns matching capabilities
- Query with k tag filter returns only matching kinds
- Query with agent type filter returns only matching types
- Query with maxPrice filter excludes expensive capabilities
- Query with ILP address prefix filter matches correctly
- Sorting by pricing works correctly
- Sorting by capacity works correctly
- Sorting by freshness works correctly
- parseCapability handles valid events correctly
- parseCapability skips invalid events gracefully
- Combined filters work correctly (e.g., kind + type + price)
- Empty results when no matches
- Limit parameter restricts results
- followedOnly filter works (integration with FollowGraphRouter)

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - Example Unit Test Structure]

**Mock Strategy:**

- Mock AgentEventDatabase.queryEvents() to return test events
- Mock relay client (if implementing relay queries in this story)
- Use capability events created by CapabilityPublisher (from Story 18.2 tests) as test data
- Test with various combinations of tags present/missing
