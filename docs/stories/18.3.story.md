# Story 18.3: Pricing Tag Generation from Skill Registry

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer implementing agent capability pricing,
**I want** to generate pricing tags dynamically from skill registry configuration,
**so that** agent capabilities accurately reflect the pricing for each supported event kind.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each skill can declare its base price
2. Pricing tags generated for all priced skills
3. Support for multiple pricing models (flat, per-token, per-byte)
4. Override pricing via agent config
5. Pricing exposed via get_agent_info skill
6. Validation that all DVM kinds have pricing

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Extend AgentSkill interface with pricing field (AC: 1,3)
  - [ ] Add optional `pricing` field to `AgentSkill` interface in `packages/connector/src/agent/ai/skill-registry.ts`
  - [ ] Define pricing structure: `{ base: bigint; model: 'flat' | 'per-token' | 'per-byte'; perUnit?: bigint }`
  - [ ] Update SkillSummary to include pricing information
  - [ ] [Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.3 Technical Notes, AI Agent Skills Architecture]

  - [ ] Update `_buildPricingTags()` method in `packages/connector/src/agent/discovery/capability-publisher.ts`
  - [ ] Extract pricing from skill registry for each registered skill
  - [ ] Generate pricing tag for each (kind, pricing) pair
  - [ ] Format: `['pricing', kind.toString(), base.toString(), 'msat']`

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 18.2 created the CapabilityPublisher with a placeholder `_buildPricingTags()` method that returns an empty array. This story will complete that implementation.

Key insights:

- `_buildPricingTags()` already exists as a private method (line 208-216)
- Method signature needs updating to accept optional overrides
- CapabilityPublisher already calls `_buildPricingTags()` in publish()
- TAG_NAMES.PRICING constant already defined in types.ts

[Source: Story 18.2 Dev Agent Record - Completion Notes]

### Data Models

**AgentSkill Pricing Extension:**

```typescript
interface AgentSkill<T extends z.ZodTypeAny = z.ZodTypeAny> {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: T;
  execute: (params: z.infer<T>, context: SkillExecuteContext) => Promise<EventHandlerResult>;
  eventKinds?: number[];
  pricing?: {
    base: bigint; // Base price in millisatoshis
    model: 'flat' | 'per-token' | 'per-byte';
    perUnit?: bigint; // Price per unit (for per-token/per-byte models)
  };
}
```

**Pricing Tag Format:**

- Tag: `['pricing', kind, amount, currency]`
- Example: `['pricing', '5000', '100', 'msat']`
- `kind`: Event kind as string
- `amount`: BigInt price as string (in smallest unit)
- `currency`: 'msat' | 'sat' | 'usd'

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.3 Technical Notes, Story 18.1 - types.ts TAG_NAMES]

**CapabilityPublisherConfig Extension:**

```typescript
interface CapabilityPublisherConfig {
  // ... existing fields
  pricingOverrides?: Map<
    number,
    {
      base: bigint;
      model: 'flat' | 'per-token' | 'per-byte';
      perUnit?: bigint;
    }
  >;
}
```

### File Locations

Based on Epic 18 Package Structure and existing files:

    └── get-agent-info-skill.ts        # UPDATE: Expose pricing (if exists)
```

[Source: Source Tree, Story 18.2 File List]

### Technical Constraints

**BigInt Handling:**

- Pricing amounts are bigint in TypeScript
- Convert to string for tag values: `amount.toString()`
- Currency is always 'msat' for ILP consistency
- JavaScript `bigint` cannot be JSON serialized directly

[Source: Story 18.1 - BigInt Usage, Data Models]

**Pricing Models:**

- **flat**: Single price regardless of input size (e.g., query: 100 msat)
- **per-token**: Base price + perUnit × token count (e.g., translation)
- **per-byte**: Base price + perUnit × byte count (e.g., storage)
- For Kind 31990 tags, only `base` price is advertised (per-unit pricing negotiated separately)

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.3 Technical Notes]

**DVM Validation:**

- DVM (Data Vending Machine) agents MUST have pricing for all supported kinds
- This is a NIP-90 requirement for DVM agents
- Non-DVM agents (assistant, specialist, coordinator, relay) may have free services
- Validation should throw error during publish if DVM has unpriced kinds

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.3 AC 6, Agent Type Classification]

**Override Precedence:**

- Config overrides take precedence over skill-declared pricing
- If skill has pricing AND override exists for same kind, use override
- If skill has no pricing and no override, no pricing tag generated
- If skill has no pricing but override exists, use override

[Source: Epic 18 PRD - Story 18.3 AC 4]

**SkillRegistry Access:**

- Use `getSkillSummary()` to get all skills with eventKinds and pricing
- SkillSummary interface needs extending to include pricing
- Registry is passed to CapabilityPublisher in constructor

[Source: AI Agent Skills Architecture - SkillRegistry, Story 18.2 Implementation]

**Error Handling:**

- DVM validation errors should prevent publish (throw)
- Pricing format errors should throw (invalid bigint, missing fields)
- Skills without pricing are silently skipped (not an error)
- Log warnings for unpriced DVM kinds before throwing

[Source: Coding Standards - Error Handling]

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**

- `packages/connector/src/agent/discovery/__tests__/capability-publisher.test.ts` (update)
- `packages/connector/src/agent/ai/__tests__/skill-registry.test.ts` (update or create)

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - File Convention]

**Test Standards:**

- Framework: Jest 29.7.x with TypeScript support (ts-jest)
- Coverage Requirement: >80% line coverage for connector package
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock dependencies: SkillRegistry

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - AI Agent Requirements]

**Specific Test Cases Required:**

CapabilityPublisher tests:

- Pricing tags generated for skills with pricing
- Multiple event kinds generate multiple pricing tags
- Skills without pricing are skipped (no tags)
- Pricing overrides applied correctly
- DVM agents with unpriced kinds throw error
- Non-DVM agents with unpriced kinds pass
- Pricing models (flat, per-token, per-byte) handled
- BigInt to string conversion correct

SkillRegistry tests:

- Skills can be registered with pricing
- getSkillSummary includes pricing
- Skills without pricing work correctly

[Source: Test Strategy - Unit Tests - Example Unit Test Structure]

**Mock Strategy:**

- Mock SkillRegistry.getSkillSummary() to return skills with pricing field
- Include mix of priced and unpriced skills
- Test different pricing models
