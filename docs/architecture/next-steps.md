# Next Steps

After completing this architecture document:

1. **Proceed to Implementation:**
   - Use this document as the definitive reference for all coding decisions
   - Start with Epic 1 (Foundation & Core ILP Protocol Implementation)
   - Implement stories sequentially as defined in PRD

2. **Extract Agent-Specific Files:**
   - **docs/architecture/tech-stack.md** - Technology stack table for quick reference
   - **docs/architecture/coding-standards.md** - Critical rules for dev agent
   - **docs/architecture/source-tree.md** - Directory structure for file creation

3. **Review with Product Owner:**
   - Validate architectural decisions align with MVP goals
   - Confirm technology choices meet project constraints
   - Approve before significant implementation begins
