# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Provide developers and educators with a zero-config, containerized ILP network that can be deployed in under 5 minutes
- Make Interledger packet routing observable through real-time visualization and comprehensive logging
- Enable rapid experimentation with different network topologies and routing scenarios
- Reduce debugging time for ILP integration issues by 50% through enhanced visibility
- Support educational adoption of Interledger by making abstract protocol concepts tangible
- Deliver RFC-compliant ILPv4 and BTP implementations suitable for development and testing environments

## Background Context

The Interledger Protocol enables payments across different ledgers and payment networks through multi-hop routing via connector nodes. However, the current ecosystem lacks developer tools that provide visibility into packet flow and routing decisions. Existing implementations like Interledger.js focus on production functionality but offer minimal observability features, making debugging and learning challenging.

This project addresses the gap by building an observability-first ILP connector with Docker orchestration, real-time network visualization, and comprehensive logging. By containerizing multiple interconnected nodes and providing a web-based dashboard showing animated packet flow, the system will serve dual purposes: education (making ILP concepts accessible) and development (enabling efficient debugging of routing issues). The project implements RFC-0027 (ILPv4) for packet routing and RFC-0023 (BTP) for ledger-layer communication, positioning it as both a learning tool and a practical development environment for the Interledger ecosystem.
