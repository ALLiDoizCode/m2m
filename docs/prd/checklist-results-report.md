# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 92%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps:**
  1. Missing explicit user journey flows (deferred to UX expert based on brief)
  2. Limited stakeholder input documentation (solo project, expected)
  3. Some integration testing details deferred to implementation

## Category Analysis Table

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PASS | None - backed by comprehensive brief |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | None - clear in/out scope with rationale |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PARTIAL | User flows not detailed (deferred to UX expert per next steps) |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | None - 20 FRs with RFC traceability |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | None - 12 NFRs with measurable targets |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | None - logical sequencing, appropriate sizing |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PASS | None - comprehensive tech stack decisions |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data schema deferred to architect (appropriate) |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PASS | None - clear technical writing throughout |

## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None

**HIGH:**
- User journey flow diagrams not included (mitigated: UX expert will handle per next steps section)

**MEDIUM:**
- Stakeholder input section sparse (acceptable for solo open-source project)
- Integration testing details high-level (acceptable at PRD stage)

**LOW:**
- Could add more visual diagrams for network topology examples
- Could expand performance benchmarking details

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope is appropriate:**
- Each epic delivers incremental value (protocol → network → visualization → polish)
- Stories sized for AI agent execution (2-4 hour chunks per brief guidance)
- 27 stories across 4 epics = realistic for 3-month timeline with part-time effort
- Out-of-scope items clearly documented (STREAM, settlement engines, production security)

**No features recommended for cutting** - all are essential for "observable ILP network" core value proposition

**No missing essential features identified** - requirements comprehensively cover brief's MVP scope

**Complexity managed:**
- Epic 1 tackles highest risk (RFC implementation) first
- BTP protocol isolated in Epic 2 for focus
- Visualization (Epic 3) builds on stable foundation
- Epic 4 is lower risk (polish/docs)

**Timeline realism:** 3-month estimate reasonable given:
- Monorepo reduces integration overhead
- TypeScript shared types streamline development
- In-memory architecture simplifies state management
- Solo developer can maintain focus without coordination overhead

## Technical Readiness

**Technical constraints clarity:** Excellent
- All tech stack decisions documented with rationale
- RFC compliance requirements explicit (ILPv4, BTP, OER, addressing)
- Docker/containerization approach clear
- Performance targets quantified (NFRs)

**Identified technical risks:**
- BTP WebSocket implementation complexity (mitigated: Epic 2 dedicated to this)
- Visualization performance at high packet rates (mitigated: NFR3 specifies target, Story 4.9 validates)
- Custom ILP packet implementation (mitigated: educational value outweighs risk, test vectors ensure correctness)

**Areas for architect investigation:**
- Telemetry protocol design (push vs pull, batching strategy)
- Cytoscape.js layout algorithm selection for different topologies
- Docker networking configuration for BTP WebSocket communication
- Performance optimization strategies if NFRs not initially met

## Recommendations

**For PM:**
1. ✅ PRD is ready to hand off to UX expert and architect
2. Consider adding simple topology diagram to PRD (optional, low priority)
3. After UX expert completes work, validate that UI flows align with functional requirements

**For UX Expert:**
1. Create detailed user journey flows for primary use cases:
   - Deploy network and observe first packet
   - Debug failed packet routing
   - Experiment with custom topology
2. Design detailed wireframes for dashboard UI (network graph, packet detail panel, log viewer)
3. Validate information architecture supports core user goals (observability, debugging)

**For Architect:**
1. Design telemetry protocol specification (message schemas, WebSocket transport details)
2. Define module boundaries and interfaces between packages (connector, dashboard, shared)
3. Create sequence diagrams for critical flows (packet forwarding with telemetry emission)
4. Specify Docker networking configuration and container orchestration details
5. Design testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E) with concrete examples
6. Investigate and recommend Cytoscape.js layout algorithms for visualization

**Next Actions:**
1. Output full PRD to docs/prd.md
2. Generate UX expert prompt
3. Generate architect prompt
4. (Optional) Create visual diagrams to supplement PRD

## Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and provide sufficient detail for architectural design to proceed. The functional and non-functional requirements are clear and testable. The epic breakdown follows agile best practices with logical sequencing and appropriate story sizing. Technical assumptions provide clear constraints for the architect. The minor gaps identified (user flows, data schema details) are appropriately deferred to specialist roles (UX expert, architect) and do not block progress.
