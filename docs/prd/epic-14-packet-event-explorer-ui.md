# Epic 14: Packet/Event Explorer UI

## Executive Summary

Deliver a per-node web-based explorer interface embedded in each connector that visualizes packets and events flowing through the M2M network in real-time. The explorer provides block explorer-style inspection capabilities for ILP packets, TOON events, settlements, and agent activity, with full event persistence via libSQL for historical browsing and analysis.

## Vision

Create a comprehensive observability layer that enables:

- **Real-time event streaming** from the local connector node
- **Block explorer-style navigation** of ILP packets, settlements, and agent events
- **Deep packet inspection** with OER field decoding and TOON content display
- **Historical event browsing** with search, filtering, and pagination
- **Account and settlement tracking** for balance monitoring
- **Educational debugging** supporting the project's learning-first philosophy

## Architecture Decision: Embedded Per-Node Explorer

### Key Insight

Each connector node serves its own explorer UI on a dedicated port (default: 3001), providing a self-contained observability interface without external dependencies:

- Explorer is part of the connector deployment (single Docker image)
- Each node shows only its own perspective (sent/received events)
- No centralized dashboard aggregation complexity
- Aligns with M2M's educational approach (see one node's view clearly)

### Benefits

| Alternative Approach            | Embedded Explorer Approach        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Separate dashboard deployment   | Single deployment unit per node   |
| Network-wide aggregation        | Node-local perspective (clear)    |
| Complex multi-node coordination | Independent per-node operation    |
| Additional infrastructure       | Zero additional services required |

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Event Stream

Live WebSocket connection from browser to connector displaying:

- **ILP Packets**: Prepare, Fulfill, Reject with routing metadata
- **TOON Events**: Agent Society Nostr events with decoded content
- **Settlement Events**: Account balances, threshold triggers, completions
- **Payment Channel Events**: Opens, updates, settlements, closures
- **Security Events**: Rate limits, suspicious activity, wallet mismatches

### 2. Event Persistence

libSQL database for each connector storing all telemetry events:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Telemetry event type
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- Unix timestamp (ms)
  node_id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Connector node ID
  direction TEXT,                     -- 'sent' | 'received' | 'internal'
  peer_id TEXT,                       -- Related peer if applicable
  packet_id TEXT,                     -- ILP packet ID if applicable
  amount TEXT,                        -- Amount (as string for BigInt)
  destination TEXT,                   -- ILP destination address
  payload TEXT NOT NULL               -- Full event JSON
);

CREATE INDEX idx_events_type ON events(event_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_timestamp ON events(timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_packet ON events(packet_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_peer ON events(peer_id);
```

### 3. Event Table View

Searchable, filterable table with columns:

| Column      | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Time        | Relative timestamp (e.g., "2s ago") |
| Type        | Event type badge (color-coded)      |
| Direction   | → Sent / ← Received / ⟳ Internal    |
| Peer        | Related peer node ID                |
| Destination | ILP address (for packets)           |
| Amount      | Value transferred (for payments)    |
| Status      | Success/Failure indicator           |

### 4. Event Detail Panel

Expandable detail view showing:

- **Raw Event JSON**: Formatted, syntax-highlighted
- **ILP Packet Fields**: Decoded OER fields with explanations
- **TOON Content**: Parsed Nostr event with kind-specific rendering
- **Related Events**: Links to corresponding Fulfill/Reject for Prepares
- **Timing**: Full timestamp, latency if applicable

### 5. Filters and Search

- **Event Type Filter**: Multi-select by event category
- **Time Range**: Quick selectors (1m, 5m, 1h, 24h) + custom range
- **Text Search**: Search across destination, peer, packet ID
- **Direction Filter**: Sent only, received only, all
- **Amount Filter**: Greater than / less than threshold

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing connector APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] TelemetryEmitter interface unchanged (only adds EventStore consumer)
- [ ] BTP WebSocket server unaffected (separate port)
- [ ] No performance impact on packet processing (<1% overhead)
- [ ] UI build failure does not prevent connector startup (graceful fallback)
- [ ] Works with all existing Docker Compose topologies

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Event storage consuming excessive disk space
- **Mitigation**: Configurable retention limits; automatic pruning job
- **Rollback Plan**: `EXPLORER_ENABLED=false` disables feature entirely

- **Secondary Risk**: WebSocket connections overwhelming connector
- **Mitigation**: Max connections limit; connection rate limiting
- **Rollback Plan**: Restart connector with explorer disabled

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 7 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Explorer accessible on each node in all Docker topologies
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage for explorer-specific code
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show <1% overhead on packet processing
- [ ] UI tested across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design verified on tablet/phone viewports
- [ ] Documentation updated with explorer usage guide
- [ ] No regression in existing connector functionality

## Dependencies

- **Epic 12**: Multi-Chain Settlement (settlement event types)
- **Epic 13**: Agent Society Protocol (TOON events, libSQL infrastructure)

## Technical References

- **Telemetry Types**: `packages/shared/src/types/telemetry.ts`
- **TelemetryEmitter**: `packages/connector/src/telemetry/telemetry-emitter.ts`
- **libSQL**: Reuse from Epic 13 AgentEventDatabase pattern
- **shadcn/ui**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs (v4)
