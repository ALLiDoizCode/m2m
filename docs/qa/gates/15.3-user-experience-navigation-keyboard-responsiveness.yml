nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Frontend-only changes. URL params parsed defensively with try/catch and allowlist validation. window.open uses noopener,noreferrer."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bundle +14% (309 kB) within threshold. Code-split lazy loading. useCallback/ref patterns prevent unnecessary re-renders. Passive scroll listener."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All async/error paths wrapped in try/catch with silent fallbacks. Event listener cleanup in all useEffect hooks. Initial mount guard prevents URL double-write."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean hook separation (useKeyboardNavigation, useMediaQuery, useEventFilters). Co-located tests. shadcn-ui Dialog component follows v4 patterns. DetailPanelContent extracted to avoid duplication."
