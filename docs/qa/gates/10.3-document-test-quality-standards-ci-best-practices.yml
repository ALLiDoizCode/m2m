  Story 10.3 successfully consolidates all Epic 10 test quality and CI/CD best practices into
  comprehensive, discoverable, and actionable documentation. The documentation is exceptionally
  well-organized with clear navigation paths, practical examples, and extensive cross-references.

  All 7 acceptance criteria have been met completely:
  - AC 1: Test quality anti-patterns (6 total, including 3 new in Story 10.3)
  - AC 2: CI troubleshooting guide (7 scenarios with resolution steps)
  - AC 3: Epic branch workflow with pre-push checklist
  - AC 4: Investigation runbook with diagnostic commands and log locations
  - AC 5: Documentation discoverable via README, developer index, and cross-links
  - AC 6: Examples include actual project code snippets
  - AC 7: GitHub Actions workflow best practices (5 practices, enhancement guidelines)

  Developer velocity will significantly improve with clear CI troubleshooting (hours → minutes),
  epic branch workflow (prevents rework), and consolidated documentation (improves onboarding).

  No issues identified. Gate: PASS with quality score 100/100.
  Story ready for Done status.
