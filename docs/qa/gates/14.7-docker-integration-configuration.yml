    status: PASS
    notes: "Explorer uses graceful degradation - failures don't prevent connector startup. Build size documented as acceptable (492KB JS)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper lifecycle management with EventStore/ExplorerServer stopped before health server. Error handling for port conflicts and validation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Clear separation of concerns. Follows existing ConfigLoader patterns."
