  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API keys correctly omitted from logs. No hardcoded secrets. Dynamic imports reduce attack surface."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lazy loading via dynamic imports. Config parsing is startup-only, no hot-path impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "AI initialization failure is non-fatal (fallback to direct dispatch). All error paths handled with try-catch."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean type definitions, consistent patterns with existing codebase, comprehensive test suite, good documentation."
