  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Private keys never persisted, only derived on-demand. Database contains only public addresses. Password stored in memory for seed derivation. Security test validates no private keys in logs or database."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "68ms per wallet (100 wallets in 6.8s). Meets performance requirements with in-memory caching. Projected 11.3 minutes for 10,000 wallets (acceptable for batch operations)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deterministic derivation verified. Database persistence tested. Index collision prevention working correctly. Race condition in batch derivation was discovered and fixed during review."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with proper separation of concerns. Well-documented with comprehensive comments. Optional database path parameter added for testing flexibility. Follows project coding standards."
