# The exposure machinery is retired, not restated

**Status:** Accepted. **Retires the exposure machinery**: `record_inbound_delivery`, `is_over_ceiling`, `PeerConfig::ceiling` and `flush_interval_ms`. Verified in the tree — `ceiling` and `flush_interval_ms` survive only as config keys parsed to be rejected by name, and `ExposureView` / `GET /exposure` are gone.

**Scope:** protocol law — binds every implementation, not just this one. See the [ADR index](README.md).

ADR 0031 (issue #868/B1) retired the credit window as the peer path's operating mode — every peer
PREPARE now carries its own covering claim, or is greeted — but explicitly left one question open:
"the exposure machinery's remaining purpose is undecided here... `record_inbound_delivery`, `ceiling`
and `flush_interval_ms` either go away or become a residual safety bound with a restated purpose."
This is that decision (issue #882, child B5): **the machinery is removed, not restated.**

## Context

Before this issue, three things still ran on every accepted peer PREPARE even though B1--B3 (ADR
0031, issues #880, #881) had already made a covering claim mandatory on both ends of the peer path:

- `ClaimBook::record_inbound_delivery` journalled a `JournalEntry::InboundFulfillmentRecorded` entry
  on every peer fulfilment, folded by `Projection::exposure` into "value delivered but not yet
  covered by an accepted claim."
- `Connector::handle_peer_prepare` checked `ClaimBook::is_over_ceiling` ahead of every forward and
  rejected `T04_INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY` once a channel's exposure exceeded its configured `ceiling`.
- `PeerConfig::ceiling`/`flush_interval_ms`, and the accept-only load-time requirement
  (`ConfigError::AcceptOnlyPeerWithoutCeiling`) that a peering this connector cannot dial must carry
  an explicit `ceiling`, since it cannot originate a FLUSH.

Two independent defects were found in this machinery while it sat undecided (issue #882's own
thread, verified against `568b9e4f`):

- **`PeerConfig::ceiling`'s doc comment claimed `None` means "the runtime's own default."** There
  was no such default: `connector-cli/src/runtime.rs`'s `wire_peer_channels` called
  `Connector::with_channel_ceiling` only when a peering configured a figure, so an unset ceiling made
  `ClaimBook::is_over_ceiling` answer `false` without ever reading the projection. `None` was
  unbounded in effect, not "defaulted."
- **The off-by-one.** `Projection::is_over_ceiling` was `exposure > ceiling`, and exposure is still
  `0` when a PREPARE's ceiling check runs (it is only incremented afterward, on fulfilment) — so a
  configured `ceiling = 0` still admitted one uncovered packet before `T04` ever fired.

Neither defect is what settles this ADR by itself: fixing them would have been straightforward, and
"the ceiling has bugs" is not the same claim as "the ceiling has no job." What settles it is that,
under B1--B3's rule, the ceiling's job — bounding trailing exposure between a fulfilment and the
claim that eventually covers it — describes a window that no longer opens in normal operation.
`ClaimBook::record_inbound_delivery` still ran on every fulfilment and `is_over_ceiling` still read
its accumulation, but the covering-claim requirement had already made the quantity they tracked
structurally small: a claim now arrives with (or ahead of) the packet it covers, not after it.

**The throughput cost of keeping it anyway is now measured**, not assumed (issue #879, PR #895,
`crates/connector-runtime/examples/peer_claim_journal_bench.rs`; kernel-counted `fdatasync` per
forwarded packet, 500 packets, reproduced across two runs, buzz-huddles rate 49fps):

| path                             | syncs/pkt | p50 @ 49fps | p99 @ 49fps |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| baseline (no claim, no exposure) | 1.00      | 1.80 ms     | 2.97 ms     |
| credit window (pre-#868)         | 2.00      | 3.18 ms     | 7.53 ms     |
| covering claim, exposure kept    | 3.00      | 4.81 ms     | 9.36 ms     |
| covering claim, exposure retired | 2.00      | 3.40 ms     | 7.74 ms     |

Keeping the exposure machinery alongside a covering-claim requirement costs a **third** `fdatasync`
per packet — roughly +1.8 ms at p99 at the huddles rate — because `record_inbound_delivery` is a
second durable journal write on top of the claim's own. Retiring it costs nothing measurable versus
what already ships: `covering claim, exposure retired` and `credit window` both sit at 2.00 syncs/pkt,
and the retired path's own p99 (7.74 ms) is within run-to-run noise of the credit window's (7.53 ms).
"Remove it" and "keep it as a residual bound" were not equally priced, and the price is what tips
this decision: a residual bound whose window structurally does not open in normal operation, kept at
a real and measured throughput cost, is exactly the kind of undocumented, unjustified machinery
issue #863 was filed about.

## Decision

**The exposure/ceiling/flush machinery is removed, not kept as a residual bound.** Concretely:

- `ClaimBook::record_inbound_delivery`, `ClaimBook::exposure`/`is_over_ceiling`,
  `ClaimBook::exposure_views`, `Projection::exposure`/`is_over_ceiling`, `Connector::exposure`,
  `Connector::with_channel_ceiling`, the `ExposureView` operator-surface type and its `GET /exposure`
  endpoint, and the `toon_exposure`-feeding code path are all deleted from the runtime.
- `PeerConfig::ceiling`/`flush_interval_ms` are removed as **live** config: `RawPeer` keeps both
  field names as parsed-and-rejected traps (`ConfigError::PeerCeilingRemoved`/
  `PeerFlushIntervalRemoved`), the same convention `addr`/`peer_wire_addr` established for ADR 0027 —
  a devnet box's bind-mounted TOML that still names either key gets a named, actionable error at
  boot, not a silent `deny_unknown_fields` drop or an unexplained refusal to start. `ceiling`'s
  accept-only load-time requirement (`AcceptOnlyPeerWithoutCeiling`) is removed along with the field
  it required: an accept-only peering's only real bound was that ceiling, and the covering-claim
  requirement already bounds every peering, accept-only or not.
- `Connector::handle_peer_prepare` drops its now-unused `channel_id: Option<String>` parameter —
  the ceiling check and `record_inbound_delivery` call were its only readers — which in turn retires
  the carriage-side bookkeeping that existed only to supply it: `connector-peer-btp`'s
  `AcceptedClaims::known_channel`/`note_channel`/`channel_for`, and `InProcessPeerTransport`'s
  `known_channel_id` tracking and `set_peer_channel`.
- `JournalEntry::InboundFulfillmentRecorded` **stays** in the domain journal alphabet, but is now a
  historical entry kind: nothing produces it any more, and `Projection::apply` folds it into nothing.
  This is a durability decision, not an oversight — a devnet box's on-disk journal from before this
  change may still contain these entries, and the journal format must keep decoding them rather than
  fail a replay or need a migration tool. The same reasoning keeps `RejectCode::t04_insufficient_liquidity`
  (`T04`, a standard ILPv4 code, RFC-0027) in `connector-domain` for wire interop, even though nothing
  in this codebase emits it any more.
- `toon_exposure`, the always-zero Prometheus gauge ADR 0014 declared, keeps its name for
  scrape-config stability but its help text now says plainly that the thing it named is gone and it
  will never have a producer — unlike `toon_settlement_total`, which is still a legitimate
  placeholder for pending work (issue #425).
- **Issue #424's projection-divergence report goes with the accounting it checked.**
  `ProjectionDivergence`, `Projection::divergences` and `Projection::known_channels` are deleted,
  and `ClaimBook::set_journal`/`Connector::with_journal` no longer return a divergence list for
  `connector-cli` to log. The one invariant that report checked was "an accepted claim's cumulative
  never exceeds what this connector's own journal recorded fulfilling on that channel" — computable
  only from `inbound_fulfilled`, which nothing writes any more, so keeping it would report every
  accepted claim as a divergence. #424's criterion is retired with its subject, not silently
  dropped; nothing about journal replay itself is weakened, and an unreplayable journal is still a
  named `RuntimeError::JournalUnreplayable` refusal to start.
- **`connector-peer-btp::warn_if_claim_ack_outlives_flush`/`warn_if_claim_ack_outlives` are deleted**
  with `flush_interval_ms`, and with them `peer-carriage-spec.md` §6.3's
  `claim_ack_timeout_ms <= flush_interval_ms` SHOULD — a coherence check between two figures of
  which only one still exists. See "Considered options" below for why the surviving figure does not
  inherit the warning.

## Considered options

**Keep the ceiling as a residual safety bound, fixing both defects.** This was ADR 0031's own
suggested "restated purpose" branch: `ceiling = 0` would mean zero, and the bound would cover
"in-flight exposure between a claim and its ack." Rejected on the measured cost above — a third
`fdatasync` per packet for a window that does not open in normal operation is not a bound worth
paying for, and B1--B3 already established that a claimless PREPARE is refused outright rather than
tracked and bounded. There is no longer an uncovered-but-tolerated state for a ceiling to describe.

**Keep `flush_interval_ms` alone, dropping only `ceiling`/exposure.** Rejected: `flush_interval_ms`
has no producer today either. `connector-peer-btp::warn_if_claim_ack_outlives_flush`, the one
function that read it, had zero callers anywhere in the codebase (confirmed by exhaustive grep) —
there was never a scheduled flush task reading this value, only a load-time coherence warning
nothing invoked. Keeping a config key whose only consumer was already dead code is the same
undocumented-machinery problem this ADR closes for `ceiling`.

**Delete `JournalEntry::InboundFulfillmentRecorded` outright**, since nothing produces it. Rejected:
`JournalEntry` is a durable on-disk format (ADR 0005), not an in-memory type. A devnet box that ran a
pre-#882 build may hold a journal file containing these entries; deleting the enum variant would make
`FileJournal::read_all` fail to decode that file rather than degrade gracefully. Keeping the variant
as an intentionally-ignored historical entry costs one match arm and is the same shape ADR 0027 chose
for `addr`/`peer_wire_addr` at the config layer.

## Consequences

**Migration.** An operator with `ceiling`/`flush_interval_ms` set in a config gets a named,
actionable error at load (`PeerCeilingRemoved`/`PeerFlushIntervalRemoved`), not a silent drop or a
generic `deny_unknown_fields` message — delete the key, no replacement is needed, since the
covering-claim requirement (ADR 0031) already provides what these approximated. This repo's own
devnet configs (`infra/linode-{relay,store,node}/connector-rust.toml`) are updated in the same
change that lands this ADR, so no live box is left holding a key the binary now refuses.

**The operator surface loses `GET /exposure`.** Nothing populated it with real data even before this
ADR reached the accept pipelines that gate on a covering claim (B2/B3 already ran ahead of
`handle_peer_prepare`'s ceiling check), so its removal is not a loss of an operationally-relied-on
number, and keeping it would mean an endpoint that always answers `[]`.

**`handle_peer_prepare`'s signature shrinks**, and with it the carriage-layer channel-tracking that
existed only to fill its now-removed parameter. This is a larger diff than the config/runtime
surfaces alone, but leaving an unused parameter (and the bookkeeping built to supply it) in place
would be exactly the inert-but-undocumented state issue #863, and this issue, exist to close.

**Nothing about claim exchange, watermarks, or on-chain redemption changes.** `ClaimBook`'s
`inbound_claimed`/`inbound_claim_nonce`/`inbound_claim_signature` state, `latest_inbound_claim`
(issue #425's redemption source), and the outbound ledger are untouched — this ADR removes only the
fulfilled-but-uncovered accounting the credit window needed and the covering-claim rule made moot,
never the claims themselves.
